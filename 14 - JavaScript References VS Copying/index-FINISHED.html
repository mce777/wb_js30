  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // basically a copy being made here
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100 cuz you made a copy

    // let name = 'Wes';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'wesley';
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too! (yes, you did)

    // Why? It's because that is an array "reference", not an array copy. They both point to the same array!


    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // since no arguments, slice just creates a copy in this case
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // OR this... create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new way cooler!!!! ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww';
    console.log(team4);

    // also cool, probably the coolest to be honest
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed !!!!

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // we think we make a copy, but this is just a reference! No good.
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a COPY instead?
    // start with blank object, then object you wish to copy, then your new stuff
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // but hold up, it's not available yet!!!
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // WAIT, HOLD ON - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    // not the coolest, cuz you're 1) stringifying then 2) converting it back
    // might be a performance hit
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
